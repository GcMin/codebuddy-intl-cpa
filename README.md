# CodeBuddy Intl CPA

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

A **CLIProxyAPI (CPA)** provider plugin for **Tencent CodeBuddy**, built for **Global (Intl)
accounts** — including the daily credit reward that other CPA plugins skip.

The account panel supports **中文 / English** via its top-right language selector.
Changes apply immediately and are remembered in the current browser. The initial
language follows the browser's language.

> **On the name.** The project is `codebuddy-intl-cpa`. The plugin it ships keeps the internal
> id `workbuddy` — the file `workbuddy.so`, the auth type `workbuddy`, the credential files
> `workbuddy-<uid>.json`, the config key `plugins.configs.workbuddy`, and the release asset
> names. That id is a host-side contract shared with every existing install and with the
> credential files already on disk, so renaming it would orphan them. Everything a human reads
> — this README, the store listing, the plugin metadata, the panel, the release title — says

## Why this one

The CPA plugins for this provider that exist today are **CN-first**: they gate the growth centre
to the domestic realm, on the assumption that the endpoint family simply does not exist
overseas. That assumption is wrong, and it leaves Global accounts with no daily income at
all — just the flat 100 credits/month free plan.

This plugin does the opposite:

| | Other CPA plugins | This plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Growth centre (`/v2/report`, heatmap, streak) | CN realm only | **CN + Global** |
| Daily credit reward on Global accounts | ✗ | ✅ **30 credits/day** |
| 429 / `code 6004` failover | falls through to the host | **in-plugin, per-account** |
| Per-request credit / token log | ✗ | ✅ **JSONL + panel** |
| Hidden upstream models | partial | ✅ **8 models** |

## Features

### 1. Daily credit reward for Global accounts (headline)

Global accounts can earn **30 credits/day per account** through the growth centre, with
no desktop app required.

How it works: the growth centre counts an *activity day* when the client reports one
event to `POST /v2/report` (`eventCode: chat_request_send`). A lit day is visible as a
non-zero `score` in `GET /activity/growth/heatmap`, and the next day the account receives
a **Bonus Pack** of 30 credits (`TCACA_code_007_nzdH5h4Nl0`, 平台奖励积分, valid 30 days).

Verified **2026-09-28 → 2026-09-29** on 7 accounts: all six Global accounts that were lit
by the report alone received their 30-credit pack the following morning (02:14–02:21 WIB),
plus one account lit by a plain client login. See [How to verify](#how-to-verify-it-yourself).

The plugin drives this on a schedule and is **idempotent per account per day** — it reads
the heatmap first and only reports days that are not lit yet, so extra runs are free.

**Built into the plugin — no external cron or script needed:**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Schedule | `08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00` local, on the shared plugin scheduler tick |
| Config | `daily_bonus: true` (default on) |
| Panel | "Daily bonus (Global)" toggle next to the CN check-in toggle |
| Manual run | `POST /v0/management/plugins/workbuddy/dailybonus` (`{"auth_index":"…"}` for one account) |
| Status | `GET /v0/management/plugins/workbuddy/dailybonus/status` — per account: day, score, lit dates |

Behaviour worth knowing:

- **"Today" comes from the API's own heatmap** (its last cell), not from local time — so
there is no timezone arithmetic and China-time day boundaries need no special handling.
- **Four ticks a day.** Because the runner skips days that are already lit, the extra
ticks are free and a tick that fails (e.g. the network is not up yet right after boot)
is covered by the next one.
- **The report POST is never retried.** The event is day-idempotent upstream, but a blind
resend would double-count the day (`score` 2 → 4). A failed send simply waits for the
next tick.
- **Global accounts only.** CN accounts keep using the check-in path, and CN growth lives
on a different host (`copilot.tencent.com`).

**Bonus:** consecutive days also unlock streak tiers (`14d` → +50 credits,
`28d` → +150 credits) on top of the daily amount.

### 2. In-plugin account failover

CPA's built-in cooldown and retry only apply to in-host executors. A `c-shared` plugin
performs its own upstream requests, so a `429` / `code 6004` never reaches the host
selector and no failover happens — the request just fails.

This plugin keeps a per-account cooldown map and retries the **same request** on another
enabled account before returning an error (`failover.go`, `retry.go`).

The dev branch also handles explicit credit exhaustion (HTTP 402, code 14018,
`Credits exhausted`) before any output chunk. It retries in the same realm and
quarantines the rejected account until the reported reset, or for 30 minutes.
The quarantine is process-local and clears on restart. It works with
`lifecycle_auto:false` and does not disable or delete auth files. Partial output,
empty HTTP 200 streams, and transport errors stop the request without replay.
Failover can incur a prompt-cache miss on the replacement account; cache sharing
varies by model/backend.

The dev branch limits chat execution to **two active requests per account** across
models and duplicate host identities (UID + realm). Up to 16 callers may wait for
30 seconds; overload stops locally without sending a paid request. Two slots let
one long-running response overlap a second session; one slot caused a 30-second
local queue timeout behind a 51-second response in production. The executor
rechecks quarantine after queueing, so a pool built before a 429 cannot keep
sending requests to that rejected account. Separate CPA processes have separate
limits; prod and dev must not use the same account concurrently.

Soft 429/code 6004 quarantine is **account + upstream model**. Credit exhaustion
remains account-wide. When all accounts for a model are cooling, a request may
probe one soft-limited account after 30 seconds, with one probe at a time per
account. A fresh rejection renews backoff. The routed ready account takes
priority; otherwise the pool picks the earliest probe across all account aliases.
The plugin does not probe exhausted or disabled accounts, cross realms, or replay
partial/empty/transport-failed responses. Upstream can still reject requests for
RPM, token-volume or shared quotas; admission cannot guarantee upstream capacity.

### 3. Per-request usage and credit log

Every chat request that flows through the plugin is recorded — account, model, input /
output / cached tokens, and the upstream `credit` value taken from the terminal SSE chunk.
Stored append-only as JSONL next to the auth store, with rotation at ~50 MB
(`request-usage-<YYYY-MM>.jsonl`, older data retained). Powers the **Usage CodeBuddy**
panel section. No credentials are ever written.

The dev branch also records content-free request hashes and actual outgoing CID
alongside usage to investigate transient cache misses. See
[cache tracing](workbuddy/docs/cache-tracing.md) for fields, privacy limits, and
the comparison script. Per-option digests identify changes to known settings
without recording their values. `scripts/study-cache-misses.py` creates a private
metadata-only report across active and rotated logs, separating prefix loss,
account changes, changed settings and normal prompt growth. It does not change
request bodies or replay cache misses.

This is also what made the cache economics visible: a 24k-token request with a full cache
hit bills ~0.05 credit instead of ~0.62.

### 4. Hidden upstream models

CodeBuddy accepts more models than its own model list advertises. This plugin exposes them
statically so they are routable:

```
gpt-5.6-luna    claude-opus-5    gpt-5.6-sol     glm-5.3
gpt-5.6-terra   deepseek-v4.1-flash   glm-5.3-flash   kimi-k3
```

### 5. Explicit CodeBuddy CN models

CN account model IDs are exposed with a `cn/` prefix, for example
`cn/glm-5.3` or `cn/space-bunny`. The prefix is removed before the request reaches
CodeBuddy. Requests using `cn/<model>` select an enabled CN account and retry
only across CN accounts, even if CPA initially routed the request to a Global
account. Bare model IDs keep the existing CPA routing behavior.

### 6. Global / Intl realm handling

Realm detection accepts both issuers (`workbuddy.ai` **and** `codebuddy.ai`), so Intl
credentials route to the correct billing and chat hosts instead of being sent to the CN
gateway (which answers a non-JSON 401 and surfaces as `parse failed: invalid character '<'`).

### 7. Model Manager (dev branch, not yet released)

Open **Global Models** or **CN Models** in the panel to edit the realm catalog,
prefix, custom models, and optional fallbacks. Save applies to all accounts in
that realm; per-account overrides are retired. Save/Reset reports whether CPA
reloaded `/v1/models` without a restart. Re-fetch updates the catalog while
preserving unsaved drafts; closing the popup discards those drafts.

Fetch-account dropdowns display the same nickname as account cards; requests
keep their stable account IDs. For the host **Auth Files** cards, which belong
to CPAMC rather than this plugin, see the [CPAMC source patch](patches/README.md).
It uses the WorkBuddy label for current and future imports without renaming files.

The **Test** button sends a paid upstream chat request. Re-fetch uses catalog
GETs without chat credits. The update widget displays the running and latest
release versions; skipped releases persist beside Model Manager state.

### 8. Inherited from the original plugin

Multi-account OAuth login, dynamic model list, chat executor, CN daily check-in, Global
one-time 250-credit expert trial, credit lifecycle (disable CN / delete Global when
exhausted), and the credits panel with CN/Global filters.

## How to verify it yourself

With any Global (Intl) account, before and after:

```bash
# 1. Is today already lit?  (score > 0 means yes)
curl -s -X GET 'https://www.workbuddy.ai/activity/growth/heatmap' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-User-Id: $UID" -H "X-Domain: codebuddy.ai"

# 2. Report one activity event
curl -s -X POST 'https://www.workbuddy.ai/v2/report' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-User-Id: $UID" -H "X-Domain: codebuddy.ai" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[{"eventCode":"chat_request_send","timestamp":1700000000000,"mode":"craft",
        "conversationId":"wb-<uuid>","requestId":"<uuid>","inputLength":12,
        "requestModelId":"deepseek-v4-flash","requestModelName":"DeepSeek V4 Flash",
        "presentAt":1700000000000,"rootRequestId":"<uuid>","parentConversationId":"wb-<uuid>",
        "agentName":"default","agentType":"conversation","userId":"'"$UID"'"}]'

# 3. The heatmap cell for today now has score 2.
# 4. Next day, check the pack arrived:
curl -s -X POST 'https://www.workbuddy.ai/v2/billing/meter/get-user-resource' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-User-Id: $UID" -H "X-Domain: codebuddy.ai" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
#    → look for a "Bonus Pack" whose PackageCode starts with TCACA_code_007
```

The reward lands the next day between **00:30 and 03:25 China time**. The heatmap lags a
successful report by a few seconds; re-read it rather than assuming failure.

## Install

### From a plugin source (recommended)

Management Center → **Config Panel → Advanced → Third-party Plugin Sources**, add:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zidanefaqih/codebuddy-intl-cpa/main/registry.json
```

Or in the host config (the plugin system is off by default):

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  store-sources:
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zidanefaqih/codebuddy-intl-cpa/main/registry.json
```

> ⚠️ **If you built the plugin yourself:** a store install records the version under
> `store:` and the host then removes the plugin's other library files, including a
> hand-built `.so`. Use a separate host/container to try the store path.

### Manual

```bash
# linux/amd64
unzip workbuddy_<version>_linux_amd64.zip     # contains workbuddy.so at the zip root
cp workbuddy.so /path/to/cliproxyapi/plugins/
```

Platform layout also works: `plugins/linux/amd64/workbuddy.so`.

## Security

A CPA plugin is a **native shared library loaded into the host process** and runs with all
of the host's access — filesystem, network, and the credentials you have configured. Only
install plugins whose source you trust, and verify the release checksums.

Releases are checksummed (`checksums.txt`, SHA-256) and built by GitHub Actions from a
tagged commit, so the published binaries correspond to the source in this repository.

This plugin stores no secrets beyond the account credentials it is given, and never prints
token material to logs or the panel.

## Credits

The executor and provider base came from **`Sliverkiss/cpa-plugin`** (MIT, since deleted
from GitHub), which itself was based on **`workbuddy` by `lovingfish`**. Thank you to both
— this project exists because that work was published.

Everything else is this repository's own work: the 429 failover, the per-request
usage/credit log, the hidden-model list, the Intl realm handling, and the Global daily
reward engine.
